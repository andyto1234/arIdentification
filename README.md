# arIdentification

##Training

The training code is writting using Jupyter Notebook (mainTraining.ipynb). You will need a data folder to put all your training data.

##Predicting
The model I use for the daily AR prediction is provided in the models folder. Simply replace it with your model if needed:D

I have configured the model to read image from a folder called latest_images. You can input any STEREO-A 195 image (256x256) and get a prediction out of it!
